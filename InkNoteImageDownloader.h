 * @brief the class is for downloading the images of ink notes which can be created
 * with the official Evernote client on Windows (only with it, at least at the time
 * of this writing).
 *
 * On all other platforms the most one can get instead of the actual ink note
 * is its non-editable image. This class retrieves just these, exclusively in PNG format.
 *
 * NOTE: almost the entirety of this class' content represents an ad-hoc solution
 * to a completely undocumented feature of Evernote service. A very small glimpse
 * of information can be found e.g. <a href="https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/7943-linux-guinea-pigs/?page=2#comment-59366">here</a>
 * but it is practically all one can find.

     * Unlike other pieces of QEverCloud API, downloading of ink note images is currently
     * synchronous only. The reason for that is that AsyncResult is bounded to a single
     * QNetworkRequest object but downloading of the ink note image might take multiple
     * requests for several ink note image's vertical stripes which are then merged
     * together to form a single image. Downloading the entire ink note's image
     * via a single request works sometimes but sometimes Evernote replies to such request
     * with messed up data which cannot be loaded into a QImage. The reason for that behaviour
     * is unknown at the moment, and, given the state of official documentation - missing -
     * it is likely to stay so. if someone has an idea how to make it more reliable,
     * please let me know.

     * @param isPublic
